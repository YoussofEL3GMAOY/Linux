| Command | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|

<br>

#### Deeper Understanding of Permissions

Permissions in Linux can be represented by Octal Notation. Each permission has a value:
*   **r (read)** = 4
*   **w (write)** = 2
*   **x (execute)** = 1

The permission values are summed for each class (owner, group, others). For example, `rwx` = 4+2+1 = 7. `r-x` = 4+0+1 = 5.
Thus, the command `chmod 755 file.sh` means:
*   **7** (rwx): The owner has all permissions.
*   **5** (r-x): The group can read and execute.
*   **5** (r-x): Others can read and execute.

| Command | Description | Example |
